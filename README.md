Machine Learning based Molecular Simulation of Nanomaterials

This repository provides the dataset, Python (COLAB) notebooks, and input scripts required to perform Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, as discussed in the book Machine Learning-based Molecular Simulation of Nanomaterials. The materials in this repository are designed to facilitate practical implementation and experimentation with MD simulations using machine learning techniques.

Contents:
Dataset: Includes raw and processed data used in MD simulations of nanomaterials. This data is crucial for conducting simulations and analyzing the behavior of nanomaterials at the molecular level.

Python Notebooks (COLAB): These Jupyter notebooks are specifically designed for Google Colab. They provide step-by-step guidance for setting up, running, and analyzing MD simulations. The notebooks include code snippets, explanations, and visualizations to support users in understanding and modifying the simulations.

Input Scripts: The repository contains scripts that define the initial configurations, force fields, and simulation parameters required to execute MD simulations as outlined in the book.

The repository offers a hands-on approach for exploring the integration of machine learning with Molecular Dynamics, allowing users to replicate and expand on the simulations described in the book. It is particularly useful for researchers and students in materials science, nanotechnology, and computational chemistry.

By utilizing these resources, users can conduct simulations to study the properties of nanomaterials and explore the potential applications of machine learning in molecular simulations.

This repository is an essential resource for anyone interested in advancing their understanding of nanomaterials through computational methods, and it offers an accessible way to implement advanced MD simulations with machine learning techniques.
